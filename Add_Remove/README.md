# PyCalc-AutoFrame: Add/Remove Elements Automation

This repository contains a Selenium-based automation framework for testing the **Add/Remove Elements** functionality of a web application. The project is built using **Python** and **pytest**, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

---

## ## Project Structure

* **`config.py`**: Centralized configuration for driver paths, timeouts, and URLs.
* **`conftest.py`**: Pytest fixtures for managing WebDriver setup and teardown.
* **`main.py`**: An interactive script that takes user input to run element cycles manually.
* **`pages/`**: Contains the logic for interacting with specific web pages (e.g., `AddRemovePage`).
* **`report.html`**: Detailed HTML execution report generated by `pytest-html`.

---

## ## Features

* **Dynamic Cycles**: Automates adding and removing elements based on specified iterations.
* **Wait Logic**: Implements implicit and explicit waits for stable element interaction.
* **Automated Reporting**: Generates visual reports showing test results, duration, and environment details.

---

## ## Prerequisites

* **Python**: 3.13.5
* **Selenium**: For browser automation
* **pytest & pytest-html**: For test execution and report generation
* **ChromeDriver**: Ensure the path in `config.py` points to your local `chromedriver.exe`

---

## ## Setup & Execution

### ### 1. Configure the Driver

Open `config.py` and update the `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH` to match your local file system:

```python
CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = r"C:\Your\Path\To\chromedriver.exe"

```

### ### 2. Run Interactively

To run the automation with custom user input:

```bash
python main.py

```

### ### 3. Run Automated Tests

To execute the full test suite and generate a report:

```bash
pytest --html=report.html

```

---

## ## Recent Test Results

The suite includes the following test cases:

* `test_add_remove_elements_cycle`
* `test_add_multiple_elements`
* `test_remove_all_elements`

Based on recent runs, the framework successfully executed all tests with **100% pass rate**.

Would you like me to create a `requirements.txt` file so you can install all dependencies at once?
